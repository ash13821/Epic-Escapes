## **Setup Instructions**

### **Front-End Setup**
1. Navigate to the front-end directory:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```
2. Install dependencies (if any):
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   Or, if it's a simple HTML/CSS/JS project, no installation is needed.
3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   Or, use **Live Server** in your code editor to preview.

### **Back-End Setup**
1. Navigate to the back-end directory:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```
2. Install the necessary dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   Or, if you're using Python:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Start the server:
   ```bash
   node server.js
   ```
   Or, for Python back-end:
   ```bash
   flask run
   ```
4. The server will run at `http://localhost:3000` (or the port specified in your code).

---

## **Running the Project**
1. Ensure the back-end server is running.
2. Open the front-end in a browser by navigating to:
   ```bash
   http://localhost:3000
   ```
   (Or the front-end port if running separately, like `http://127.0.0.1:5500`).
